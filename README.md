# Hi, I’m Vy-Vy Ngo ✌️

I'm a recent data science graduate based in the Bay Area, California. I've become a huge data nerd and have been living and breathing data. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects.  



### What I'm currently focusing on 🧐
Currently improving my machine learning skills: sklearn, imblearn, tensorflow, computer vision 

“The best way to learn data science is to do data science.”


### Outside of data...
- I love rock climbing 🧗‍♀️
- I'm always in the search for a good cup of coffee ☕
- And good food makes me happy 🍽️🍻😁
